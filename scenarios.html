      <div class="row columns">
        <p>Our cybersecurity exercises cover the topics of Network Analysis and Reconnaissance, Malware Detection and Analyzation, 
            Network Traffic Analysis and Defense, Social Engineering, and Web Security. Though our exercises can be done in any order, 
            some can be good building blocks that work towards the more advanced ones. Most of the exercises require a minimal level 
            of understanding of some standard Linux tools. We have provided some basic tutorials for Linux use in our manuals.</p>
            <p>For more in-depth information on our scenarios, see the manuals.</p>

          <h3>Ssh Inception</h3>
          <p>Ssh Inception teaches the basics of ssh, a secure program for logging into a remote machine, as well as helps familiarize
            students with the basics of the linux system. This scenario introduces some helpful tools, includin grep, ifconfig,
            nmap and ftp, to help uncover clues as you navigate through a series of network checkpoints. This is a great place
            to start for learning the foundations of networking!</p>

          <h3>Total Recon</h3>
          <p>Total Recon is a progressive, story-based game designed to teach how network protocols such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP can
            be used to reveal information about a network. This scenario focuses on reconnaissance to determine hosts in an unknown
            network. You will explore tradeoffs between speed and stealth when using tools such as nmap.</p>

          <p>One of the important skills of cyber security is being able to analyze malware. In this scenario we focus on the dynamic
            analyses of programs, using the dignostic tool strace. You are presented with the challenge of understanding what
            a process is doing based on its system calls. Through both whitebox and blackbox testing, you will learn to filter
            large amounts of data to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior.</p>

          <h3>ELF Infection</h3>
          <p>ELF Infection is an exercise to assess your understanding of the structure of an executable file. The goal is to teach
            you, having identified that a program is doing something malicious, where that code has been injected and how it
            works. This is a reverse engineering problem and can use a range of tools, including readelf, objdump, gdb, strace
            and netstat.</p>

          <h3>Treasure Hunt</h3>
          <p>Treasure Hunt is an exercise that teaches about permissions and other security loopholes in Linux. The goal of this scenario is 
            to uncover the "secret" of 16 imaginary users. This scenario covers a broad array of topics, including password cracking and the 
            .htaccess file, though it mainly focuses on the many aspects of the Linux file access permissions. This is classroom favorite and 
            great way for students test both their knowledge and determination!</p>

          <h3>Scapy Hunt</h3>
          <p>Scapy Hunt poses the challenge of analyzing network traffic to understand who is communicating with whom and how. The player is 
            trying to get data from an ftp server which is not on the same subnet, but one of the hosts on its network is communicating with it. 
            By default the player can only see packets sent to the server and must craft packets to get them routed to the target and get a response back.</p>
