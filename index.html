            <p>EDURange can help you to include cybersecurity exercises in your classes. It is easy to use, and easy for your students to sign
              up. Since it runs on the Cloud, there are no VMs or software to download or configure. You can use our scenarios, modify them,
              or even create your own. By practicing cybersecurity skills in a dynamic and customizable setting, students are rewarded by spending
              effort on thoughtful analysis, debugging, and reverse-engineering.</p>

          <h3>EDURange Scenarios</h3>
          <p>Our central focus is on creating exercises, which we call scenarios, that support and nurture the development of analysis
            skills rather than memorized scripts, recipes, or standard command line and GUI settings for a particular tool. Though some
            scenarios revolve around using a specific tool, the main learning goal is the development of the analytical skills and understanding
            of the complex system which that tool acts upon.</p>

          <div class="medium-5 columns">
            <h5><b>Engaging</b></h5>
            <p>Whether through story-based design or the pursuit for the next checkpoint in a series of incremental challenges, our
              scenarios are fun and keep students absorbed. The intrigue of our scenarios help students stay actively interested in
              their own learning process.</p>

            <h5><b>Analytical</b></h5>
            <p>Not only do our scenarios pose challenges, but they do so in a way to encourage analytical thinking. Students learn how
              to develop their own building blocks to be further used as a scenario progresses. We also provide assignment questions
              and discussion questions to continue the investigative thinking post-scenario.</p>

              they work through scenarios. Our student manuals also list helpful tools for each scenario.</p>
