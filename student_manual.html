        <h1>Introduction </h1>

        <p>EDURange is an NSF-funded project that is both a collection of interactive,
          collaborative cybersecurity exercises and framework for creating these exercises.
          This suite of exercises is intended to help supplement classroom lectures, labs, and
          other activities. </p>

        <p>We believe EDURange has a potential to significantly advance the integration of
          cybersecurity into the undergraduate computer science curriculum. By providing
          interactive, competitive exercises, it will enhance the quality of instructional
          material, and increase active learning for students. The ease of use for instructors
          will encourage them to integrate cybersecurity into the current core curriculum.
          These exercises will also provide rapid feedback to students and faculty, which
          will aid in assessment of student learning. </p>

        <p>A key question we ask ourselves in our design process is: What kind of analysis skill
          do we expect the students to acquire from running (and re-running) this scenario? Our
          central and very intense focus is on creating exercises that support and nurture the
          development of analysis skills rather than memorized scripts, recipes, or standard command
          line and GUI settings for a particular tool. Though some exercises revolve around using a
          specific tool, the main learning goal is the development of the analytical skills and
          understanding of the complex system which that tool acts upon.</p>

        <p>By keeping this focus, EDURange helps students buy into the process of sharpening their
          information security analysis skills and makes them a partner in evaluating and understanding
          the limits of those skills.</p>

        <p>Our cybersecurity exercises cover the topics of Network Analysis and Reconnaissance, Malware
          Detection and Analyzation, Network Traffic Analysis and Defense, Social Engineering, and Web Security.
          Though our exercises can be done in any order, some can be good building blocks that work towards the
          more advanced ones. Most of the exercises require a minimal level of understanding of some standard
          Linux tools. We have provided some basic tutorials for Linux use at the end of this document.</p>

        <div id="usingedurange">
        <h2>Using EDURange</h2>
        <p>Your instructor will give you an access code that you can use to register for EDURange. You will
        register at http://cloud.edurange.org. When your instructor creates an exercise and places
        you in a group, it will be accessible to you in the scenarios section of your EDURange home
        page. From there you will be able to see your login credentials as well as your initial
        instructions. You can use that to connect via ssh to the public IP address of a gateway for that
        exercise. Some exercises will also have questions to be answered via the EDURange scenario
        page. Others have questions listed in this manual that your instructor might have separate
        instructions for.</p>

        <h1>Exercises</h1>
        <h2 id="strace">Strace</h2>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Strace (dynamic analysis of binaries) poses the challenge of understanding what a process is
        doing based on its system calls. You will learn to filter large amounts of data to distinguish
        between normal and anomalous behavior.</p>
        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>One of the important skills of cyber security is being able to analyze malware. These skills
        overlap with debugging, except that the problems can be more subtle. This exercise focuses on
        dynamic analysis of programs, i.e. analyzing what a program does while it is running. It turns out
        that in order to do anything, a program or process relies heavily on the operating system. The
        system call (syscalls) can reveal a lot about what the program is doing. One of the tools for
        examining the syscalls is strace. You should first figure out where the strace binary is located
        and what some of the options are (look at the man pages).</p>
        <p>You will start with whitebox testing of some programs for which you have the source code. Then,
        you can move to blackbox testing using trace files. When reading through the traces, you will
        first need to figure out what the system calls are doing. The system calls also have man pages.
        The last strace in this example has two executables running. If you are working in a group, think
        about how you can divide up the work in an efficient way.</p>

        <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Know how to analyze the sequence of sys calls and recognize patterns</li>
          <li>Be able to determine if a program is behaving as expected</li>
          <li>Recognize when a process forks another process</li>
          <li>Recognize when a process opens a file or socket</li>
          <li>Recognize when a process deletes a file</li>
          <li>Recognize which system calls introduce threats and how that happens</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <p>Connect to the VM via your instructor’s directions, or as displayed on your EDURange account.
        Follow the Lab Assignments and Questions section below.</p>
        <p>It may be helpful to look over the Grep and Piping and Redirecting portions of the Student
        Tutorials section. They can help you filter through the results of strace.</p>

        <h4>Lab Assignments and Question</h4>
        <ol>
          <li> Your home directory contains various files that will be used in this scenario. One is the file
          empty.c, whose contents are:</li>
          <code>int main () {}</code>
          <br>
          <p>Compile this program as follows:</p>
          <code>gcc -o empty empty.c</code>
          <p>Now run strace to execute the empty program:</p>
          <code>strace ./empty</code>
          <p>What do you think the output of strace indicates in this case? How many different syscall
            functions do you see?</p>
          <li>The file hello.c contains this simple program:</li>
          <code style="display: block;"># include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>
          <code style="display: block;">int main () {</code>
          <code style="display: block;">printf("hello\n");</code>
          <code style="display: block;">}</code>
          <p>Compile hello.c to hello and execute it with strace:</p>
          <code style="display: block;">gcc –o hello hello.c</code>
          <code>strace ./hello</code>
          <p>Compare the output of strace for empty and for hello. Which part of the strace output is
          boilerplate, and which part has to do with the specific program?</p>

          <li>The -o option of strace writes its output to a file. Do the following:</li>
          <code style="display: block;">strace -o empty-trace ./empty</code>
          <code style="display: block;">strace -o hello-trace ./hello</code>
          <code style="display: block;">diff empty-trace hello-trace</code>
          <p>Explain the differences reported between traces empty-trace and hello-trace.
             (Colordiff is installed as well.)</p>
          <li> Study the program copy.c</li>
          <code style="display: block;"># include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</code>
          <code># include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;</code>
          <code>int main (int argc, char** argv) {</code>
          <code>char c;</code>
          <code>FILE* inFile;</code>
          <code>FILE* outFile;</code>
          <code>char outFileName[256];</code>
          <code>if (argc != 3) {</code>
          <code>printf("program usage: ./copy &lt;infile&gt; &lt;outfile&gt;\n");</code>
          <code>exit(1);</code>
          <code>}</code>
          <code>snprintf(outFileName, sizeof(outFileName), "%s/%s", getenv("HOME"), argv[2]);</code>
          <code>inFile = fopen(argv[1], "r");</code>
          <code>outFile = fopen(outFileName, "w");</code>
          <code>printf("Copying ‘‘%s to %s\n", argv[1], outFileName);</code>
          <code>while ((c = fgetc(inFile)) != EOF) {</code>
          <code>fprintf(outFile, "%c", c);</code>
          <code>}</code>
          <code>fclose(inFile);</code>
          <code>fclose(outFile);</code>
          <code>}</code>
          <p>Compile it to an executable named copy and use strace to execute it as follows:</p>
          <code>gcc -o copy copy.c</code>
          <code>strace ./copy tiger.txt mytiger.txt</code>
          <p>Explain the non-boilerplate parts of the trace by associating them with specific lines in copy.c.
            Are there any lines from the program that you expect to show up in the trace that don’t?</p>
          <li>The file strace-identify was created by calling strace on a command. The first line of the trace
            has been deleted to make it harder to identify. Determine the command on which strace was
            called to produce this trace.</li>
          <li> Sometimes strace prints out an overwhelming amount of output. One way to filter through the
              output is to save the trace to a file and search through the file with grep. But strace is equipped
              with some options that can do some summarization and filtering. To see some of these, try the
              following, and explain the results:</li>
          <code>find /etc/dhcp</code>
          <code>strace find /etc/dhcp</code>
          <code>strace -c find /etc/dhcp</code>
          <code>strace -e trace=file find /etc/dhcp</code>
          <code>strace -e trace=open,close,read,write find /etc/dhcp</code>
          <li>Here is a simple shell script in script.sh:</li>
          <code>#!/bin/bash</code>
          <code>echo "a" > foo.txt</code>
          <code>echo "bc" >> foo.txt</code>
          <code>echo ‘id -urn‘ >> foo.txt</code>
          <code>chmod 750 foo.txt</code>
          <code>cat foo.txt | wc</code>
          <code>chmod 644 foo.txt</code>
          <p>Compare the outputs of the following calls to strace involving this script. Explain what you see in
          the traces in terms of the commands in the script.</p>
          <code>strace ./script.sh</code>
          <code>strace -f ./script.sh</code>
          <li>The file mystery is an executable whose source code is not available. Use strace to explain
          what the program does in the context of the following examples:</li>
          <code>./mystery foo abc</code>
          <code>./mystery foo def</code>
          <code>./mystery baz ghi</code>
          <li> Create a one-line “secret.txt” file. Here’s an example, though of course you should choose
            something different as your secret:</li>
          <code>echo "My phone number is 123-456-7890" &gt; secret.txt</code>
          <p>Now display the secret to yourself using cat:</p>
          <code>cat secret.txt</code>
          <code>My phone number is 123-456-7890</code>
          <p>Is your secret really secret? How much do you trust the cat program? Start by running strace on
          cat secret.txt to determine what it's actually doing. Based on this and subsequent experiments,
          determine answers to the following questions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The cat program in the strace scenario does more than display the contents of a file?</li>
            <li>Exactly what else does it do?</li>
            <li>How can you display the contents of a file without the extra actions reported above?</li>
            <li>Can anyone else read your secret?</li>
            <li>Can you read the secrets of anyone else?</li>
            <li>How do you think the trojaned cat program was implemented? How do you think it was
            installed? Justify your explanations</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>What are the major types of syscalls? Which ones would you look for when black box testing?</li>
            <li>Explain how you would disguise a rootkit that copies a file to a hidden directory.</li>
            <li>Explain how you would disguise a rootkit that opens a reverse shell.</li>
          </ol>
          <h2 id="sshinception">SSH Inception</h2>
          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>Ssh Inception teaches the basics of ssh, a secure program for logging into a remote machine.
          You will use ssh along with some other tools to navigate through a series of network checkpoints.</p>

          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>Logging into a remote machine is one of the most basic computer networking tasks. Knowing
          the different methods and options for doing so is essential. This exercise will also introduce you
          to some other helpful tools as you navigate through the checkpoints, including grep, ifconfig,
          nmap and ftp. Though you will only use them briefly here, they are each powerful tools on their
          own that you should investigate further. Reading the man pages of these tools is the first place
          to start if you are unsure how to tackle a problem. For nmap, be sure that you only use it to
          scan the local network, which starts with 10.0.0.</p>
          <p>For grep, you can search through a large number of files with one command:</p>
          <code>grep 1234 *.txt</code>
          <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Understand what is happening when you ssh</li>
            <li>Understand key pairs and why they provide more protection than passwords</li>
            <li>Have a basic familiarity with a linux system</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <p>Connect to the VM via your instructor’s directions, or as displayed on your EDURange account.
          Instructions will be displayed upon logging in and at each new checkpoint.</p>
          <h4>Lab Assignments and Question</h4>
          <p>Questions can be found upon logging into your EDURange account.</p>
          <h4>Discussion Questions</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Why did you see the following message when you used ssh the first time to connect to the
            NAT?<li>
            <code>The authenticity of host [IP address] can't be established.</code>
            <code>ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:[hash value].</code>
            <li>What were some of the different ways each network limited or allowed a user to login?</li>
            <li>How were you able to get access to the loose ftp server? Was there another way to gain
            access? What could be done to secure the ftp server?</li>
            <li>How was the file ‘betcha_cant_read_me’ decoded? What are some other similar methods?</li>
            <li>The final problem in this exercise is a bit challenging and will require some creative thinking.</li>
            <p>Why was it difficult to stay in Satan’s Palace? There are multiple ways to get what you are
            looking for. Share with classmates how you achieved your goal. Do you understand why these
            different methods worked?</p>
          </ol>
          <h2 id="totalrecon">Total Recon</h2>
          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>Total Recon is a progressive, story-based game designed to teach how network protocols such
          as TCP, UDP, and ICMP can be used to reveal information about a network. Total Recon
          focuses on reconnaissance to determine hosts in an unknown network. You will explore
          tradeoffs between speed and stealth when using tools such as nmap.</p>
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>Whether you’re doing a large-scale security audit, inventorying a network, or analyzing network
          response times, nmap is a powerful tool to help you complete your task. In order to understand
          this exercise, you should be familiar with the 3-way handshake for TCP. A basic understanding
          of ICMP and UDP will also be helpful. This exercise is not designed to teach you all of the
          details of those protocols, but rather to show you how they can be used for network exploring.
          You will learn how to discover hosts on a network, determine which ports on those hosts are
          open, and what applications are running on them.</p>
          <p>In practice, each message that is sent over the Internet uses multiple protocols, which are
          divided into five layers: physical layer, link layer, network layer, transport layer and application
          layer. For example, the physical layer handles what is encoded as a 0 or 1. The link layer
          handles communication on local area networks (LANs). The network layer handles routing on
          wide area networks (WANs), e.g. IP. The transport layer handles ports and processes, e.g. TCP,
          UDP, ICMP. The application layer handles applications communicating with each other, e.g. http,
          ftp, by nesting packets inside of packets. In general, these packets correspond to layers of
          functionality: TCP is connection-oriented and is responsible for a number of things including
          reliably conveying messages between the application layers on two hosts. The three-way
          handshake establishes this pairing with the following sequence: SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK You
          can get a summary of the important protocols and their layers in: Chapter 4 of Hacking: The Art
          of Exploitation (Erickson)[1] or Chapter 2 of Counter Hack Reloaded [2]. Network Security by
          Kaufman, Perlman, Speciner [3]</p>
          <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Understand how the networking protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP) can be exploited for recon</li>
            <li>Know how to use nmap to find hosts and open ports on a network</li>
            <li>Recognize the standard common ports (e.g. SSH, FTP, HTTP, SMTP, IMAP)</li>
            <li>Understand the TCP flags and how they can be used for different types of scans</li>
            <li>Understand CIDR network configuration and how to subdivide a network IP range</li>
          </ol>

          </ul>
          <h2 id="elfinfection">ELF Infection</h2>
          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>ELF Infection is an exercise to assess your understanding of the structure of an executable file.
          The goal is to teach you, having identified that a program is doing something malicious, where
          that code has been injected and how it works. This is a reverse engineering problem and can
          use a range of tools, including readelf, objdump, gdb, strace and netstat.</p>
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>One of the first things most people think of when it comes to digital security are viruses! Being
          able to detect and disable malware is a never ending job as the digital world continues to
          expand. The first step towards recognizing viruses is being able to understand what is normal
          behavior for a program. If you are unfamiliar with strace, and reading system calls, you might
          want to do our strace exercise before attempting ELF Infection.</p>
          <p>As the title suggests, you will be examining the different ways ELF files can be infected. The
          files in this exercise were infected with a method called injection. 'Injection' is the process of
          inserting and smuggling a malicious payload into an ELF executable without breaking the
          executable's integrity.</p>
          <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
          <ul>
          <li>Know the capabilities of readelf and how to use the basic options</li>
          <li>Know the format of an ELF file header</li>
          <li>Know which system calls do the following -</li>
          <div style="padding-left: 50px;">- Make a new name for a file</div>
          <div style="padding-left: 50px;">- Execute a process</div>
          <div style="padding-left: 50px;">Terminate the calling process</div>
          <div style="padding-left: 50px;">Create message buffer and read from the message queue</div>
          <div style="padding-left: 50px;">Assign the local IP address and port for a socket</div>
          <li>Be familiar with the general classes of system calls</li>
          <li>Be able to read a system trace and know what is normal vs abnormal</li>
          <li>Be able to make a system call in C</li>

          <h2 id="treasurehunt">Treasure Hunt</h2>
          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>Treasure Hunt is an exercise that teaches about permissions and other security loopholes in
          Linux. In this virtual machine there are 16 imaginary users. Somewhere in his/her home
          directory, each of these imaginary users has a “secret” file named username-secret.&lt;ext&gt;
          (where &lt;ext&gt; is a file extension) whose contents are intended to be private (readable only by
          the user and no one else). However, each of their secret files can actually be read by other
          users who are both determined and clever. Your goal is to collect the contents of as many of the
          sixteen secret files as you can.</p>
          <h4>Background</h4>
          <p>There are often multiple users on the same system or network. Given this case, how does a
          system determine who is able to access specific files? Linux system of file access permissions
          are used to control who is able to read, write and execute certain files. This is used both to keep
          user files private as well as to protect critical system files. In order to obtain many of the secrets
          in this exercise, you will need to understand the read, write, and execute permissions as well as
          how permissions are applied to the owner, group owner, and every user. If you are unfamiliar
          with linux permissions, see the section on Linux File Permissions in the Student Tutorials
          section below.</p>
          <p>This exercise also utilizes password cracking for a few users. That password cracking method
          that you will work with utilizes linux password hashes. This exercise is not intended to teach
          about hashes and password security techniques. If you are unfamiliar with the general idea of
          them, a quick web search should catch you up with the basics. The files that contain the
          password hashes are not publicly available on linux systems, but we have made them so for this
          exercise and will show where to find them. Hopefully, this will give you an idea if the passwords
          you use are secure or not!</p>
          <p>You will also run into the .htaccess file in this exercise. This is a configuration file for Apache
          Web Server. It is used for many things but here it is only used from user authorization. You
          should be able to figure it out when you come across it. If not, a simple web search will help you
          out again.</p>
          <h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Know the difference between read, write, and execute permissions and how this affects
            directories and files</li>
            <li>Understand linux groups</li>
            <li>Understand what Set User ID and Set Group ID do</li>
            <li>Know how to find a file’s permissions and interpret this and similar lines ‘-rwsr-xr-x‘</li>
            <li>Be able to create a symbolic link and know what it does</li>
            <li>Recognize what sorts of passwords are easily cracked from known password hashes</li>
            <li>Have a moderate understanding of some basic linux tools and how to use them</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Instructions</h4>
          <p>Connect to the VM via your instructor’s directions, or as displayed on your EDURange account.</p>
          <p>Once logged in, it is your goal to find the secrets of the following 16 fake users:</p>
          <div style="padding-left: 50px;">
            <p>Alice Wan (awan)</p>
            <p>Bob Duomo (bduomo)</p>
            <p>Cathy Dry (cdry)</p>
            <p>Debbie Shi (dshi)</p>
            <p>Ellen Quintus (equintus)</p>
            <p>Fred Sexon (fsexon)</p>
            <p>George Hepta (ghepta)</p>
            <p>Helen Ochoa (hochoa)</p>
            <p>Inna Nunez (inunez)</p>
            <p>Jack Dekka (jdekka)</p>
            <p>Karen Elva (kelva)</p>
            <p>Loretta Douzette (ldouzette)</p>
            <p>Patricia Kaideka (pkaideka)</p>
            <p>Pyotr Theodore Radessime (pradessime)</p>
            <p>Quinn Sanera (qsanera)</p>
            <p>Tudor Daforth (tdaforth)</p>
          </div>
          <p>Each secret is contained somewhere in that user's home directory. All fake users belong to a
          group named student, a fact that is important for some of the attacks. There are other significant
          groups as well that some of these users are in.</p>
          <p>There is no strict sequential order for finding the secrets, though some you will only be able to
          get after gaining access to another user's account. Password cracking is a great place to start.
          We will walk you through that below.</p>
          <p>Accessing some secret files will require that you make changes to certain files/directories in the
          accounts of the fake users. Once you determine the secret, be sure to undo any changes that
          you make so that you leave the system exactly in the same state that you found it. Otherwise,
          you could (1) make it very easy for others to access the information you worked so hard to get
          or (2) make it impossible for others to access the information you found (this is unacceptable in
          this exercise, though not in the real world).</p>
          <p>Since some of your changes may be hard for you to undo, you can use the resetFakeUsers
          command to resets all fake user accounts to their initial states and also resets other parts of the
          system (e.g. deletes all files in the /tmp directory). Executing this command should solve all
          reseting issues; if it does not, please let us know. By calling resetFakeUsers frequently, you
          could cause a denial of service attack against your classmates; please do not do this!
          (Note: One case has been found where resetFakeUsers does not work. This is after finding a
          particular secret, so you should be able to figure out what is necessary to make it work again.)</p>
          <h4>Password Cracking:</h4>
          <p>For password cracking download John the Ripper from http://www.openwall.com/john/ onto a
          local computer. John the Ripper is not on the Treasure Hunt VM, and you won't be able to install
          it there. If you only have access to a Windows computer for your local machine, John the Ripper
          suggests HashSuite; though we won't provide you with instructions on how to use that program.</p>
          <p>On the Treasure Hunt machine, gain access to the file /etc/shadow. (See hints below if stuck).
          You will need a copy of /etc/shadow and /etc/passwd on your machine running John the Ripper.
          Use John’s unshadow command to combine /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow into a single
          password file (e.g. 'unshadow passwd shadow > mypasswd').</p>
          <p>Manually edit 'mypasswd' to exclude all accounts other than the 16 fake users for this problem –
          otherwise you’re wasting processing time in your password cracker. When you find the secret of
          a fake user, removing that user from the unshadowed file will help speed up future attempts.
          You do not want to waste processing time trying to crack passwords you don’t need!</p>
          <p>Run John on 'mypasswd' (e.g. 'john passwords'). The basic john command uses the default
          wordlist run/password.lst, which should be able to fairly quickly crack two user passwords.
          There is one more password that can be cracked, but you will need to feed john a custom word
          list. Maybe if you knew more about fake users...</p>
          <h4>User Web Pages:</h4>
          <p>Each user has at least one web page in a public html directory. Some of these pages contain
          information relevant to finding their secret. Although many of the user web pages are publicly
          readable by any user on the THVM, some can only be read via a web browser. Since you are
          logged in via ssh, you might be wondering how you can view these web pages. Lynx is a textbased web browser that we have provided for your use. Typing 'lynx localhost/~awan/' will let
          you view awan's homepage. The same format can be used to view the other 15 user's pages.
          Though you can see the public html pages in each user's directory, due to the permissions of
          any private files, you will need to use Lynx to uncover some of the secrets. See Lynx's man
          page for specific instructions. (w3m might also be installed, but the default version might not
          help you with every secret).<p>
          <h4>Hints:</h4>
          <p>- It may be helpful to export certain files from the THVM to your local computer (or vice versa).
          You can use scp or ftp from your local computer to do this.</p>
          <p>- Having trouble gaining access to /etc/shadow? Look in /bin/ and see if you can find something
          to help you.</p>
          <p>- Access to web directories can be controlled by a .htaccess file. See
          http://www.javascriptkit.com/howto/htaccess.shtml for documentation on .htaccess files.</p>
          <p>- The web server runs as user/group www-data. Including www-data in a group gives the web
          server whatever permissions are given to the group. There is a group named apache whose
          only member is www-data.</p>
          <p>- In an HTML file, text between &lt;!-- and &gt; is a comment that is not displayed by the web
          browser.</p>
          <p>- The ghostview suite is installed. The gv command can be used to display .pdf files. (Be patient;
          it is very slow when displaying a window remotely. Alternatively, you may want to export relevant
          .pdf files from the THVM to your local computer and view them there.)</p>
          <p>- It is possible to convert .pdf files to other file formats, and there are programs in the THVM for
          doing this. But saying exactly what those programs are would make one secret too easy too
          find. So you might want to research how to convert .pdf files to other formats in Linux.</p>
          <p>- .docx format is a zipped (compressed) directory of XML files; it can be uncompressed with the
          unzip command. There are many ways to obtain that secret though.</p>
          <p>- If you want to add a directory dir to the front of your PATH variable, a good way to do this is
          with the following command - export PATH= dir :$PATH (e.g. 'export PATH=/tmp/:$PATH')</p>
          <p>- The strings command could be helpful for some secrets. As well as a hex viewer.</p>
          <h2>Scapy Hunt</h2>
          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>Scapy Hunt poses the challenge of analyzing network traffic to understand who is
          communicating with whom and how. The player is trying to get data from an ftp server which is
          not on the same subnet, but one of the hosts on its network is communicating with it. By default
          the player can only see packets sent to the server and must craft packets to get them routed to
          the target and get a response back.</p>
